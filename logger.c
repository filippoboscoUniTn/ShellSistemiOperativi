/*
	CHANGES:
	- pensare a cosa deve essere singolarmente passato come parametro e cosa puÃ² essere passato come variabile d'ambiente
*/


/*
	this is the command logger source code
	this program will be called from the shell for every command to be executed
	depending on the options switch, it logs the stdout/stderr of the command and redirects it to the output pipe
	it reads from the environment: files pathnames in which to log, pipe in/out and options switches (for what informations to log)

	the logger will behave as following:
		1) catch the 1st arg treated as command's name
		2) catch the 2nd arg treated as command's parameters (if present)
		3) start scanning all environment variables for catching:
			- temporary folder pathname in which to save partial logs
			- shell's parameters' array for knowing what informations to log, and where to save it (options switches)
			- pipes's file descriptors
		4) based on the informations to save, it will open output stream files, get process informations, link pipes and allocate buffers
		5) fork --> child will execute the command
				--> father will read input pipes, log to files and then write to output pipes
		6) when the child finishes, the father flushes the buffers, closes output streams, notify the controller and then exit
